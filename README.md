# StateScope
A terminal-based dev tool that connects to a Clearnode (or a local dev one), visualizing channels, states, allocations, participants, offchain updates, dispute status, signatures. Something like a “CLI dashboard” for devs to see what state transitions have happened.
Helps debug state channel logic, helps understand misbehaviour and good for onboarding & demos.
